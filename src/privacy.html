    <strong>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Information provided by your mobile device </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Like many other applications, we may record information that your mobile
    device routinely shares, such as the date and time you accessed the App and
    the features of the App that you use. This will generally be anonymous data
    that we collect on an aggregate basis. We will not try to associate
    anonymous data with the personal information that you provide to us, except
    to investigate apparent fraud or a threat to our App, our business or our
    users. Additionally, we may use geographic location information provided by
    your mobile device to identify products and services available in your
    vicinity. We do not collect or store your geographic information except to
    provide this service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Personal information that you provide </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may also collect personal information that you choose to provide to us
    on a voluntary basis. When we ask for your personal information, it is so
    that we and third parties can provide a product or service to you and
    communicate with you about those products and services. For example, you
    can register on our App by providing us with your name, address, telephone
    number and e-mail address, and then elect to receive e-mails or receive
    notifications about new products and services. It will always be your
    choice whether to provide your personal information to take advantage of
    these features. You understand that sharing such information is completely
    voluntary. Horse Apps assumes no liability for such information.
</p>
<p>
    We may also offer certain social networking and marketplace features on
    this App, such as the opportunity to solicit products and services and to
    post comments or opinions about products and services. If you choose to
    submit your questions, comments or opinions, keep in mind that these will
    be available to the general public. Additionally, be advised that sharing
    any information with third parties offering goods and services through the
    App is completely voluntary. Any information you provide through the social
    networking and marketplace features of this App is not subject to any
    privacy, and Horse Apps assumes no liability for such information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Information Collected From Other Sources</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may obtain information about you from other sources, including social
    networks like Facebook that you use to connect with Horse Apps or the App.
    This information may include name, user name, demographic information,
    updated address or contact information, interests, and publicly-observed
    data, such as from social media and online activity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Tracking on our own App </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    As is commonly done on websites and applications, we may use cookies and
    similar technology to keep track of our users and the services they have
    elected. A "cookie" is a small text file containing alphanumeric characters
    that is stored on your computer or mobile device and uniquely identifies
    your browser. If you have created a user name and account, we will use
    cookies so that when you return to our App we can remember who you are and
    your preferences. We may allow business partners who provide services to
    our App to place cookies on your device that assist us in analyzing usage
    data. We do not allow these business partners to collect your personal
    information from our App except as may be necessary for the services that
    they provide.
</p>
<p>
    You can manage these cookies. For example, you can configure your browser
    to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is
    set. If you disable cookies, it may interfere with the functionality of our
    App and you may not be able to use all of the App’s features.
</p>
<p>
    We may also use web beacons or similar technology to help us track the
    effectiveness of our communications. A web beacon (also known as an action
    tag, a clear gif or pixel tag) is a1x1 pixel image embedded in a web page
    used to transparently collect information. For example, we may use a web
    beacon to count the number of visits to the various features of our App. If
    you have signed up to receive any of our e-mail newsletters, we use similar
    technology to count how many recipients have opened the message and clicked
    on one of its links.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Tracking by advertising services </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our App may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by
    Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics use cookies and other, similar
    technologies, to collect information about how users use the App. The
    information generated by the cookie about your use of the App (including
    your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in
    the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of
    evaluating your use of our App, compiling reports on App activity for App
    operators and providing other services relating to App activity and usage.
    Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required
    to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on
    Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other
    data held by Google. By using this App, you consent to the processing of
    data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set forth
    above. To learn more about Google Analytics, including how to opt out of
    it, visit

<p>
    Third-party websites or services (i.e. Amazon and Facebook) may use
    cookies, pixels, and similar technology to collect or receive information
    upon using this App. We may share this information with the respective
    services or platforms, but we will not include your personal information.
    This is specifically for conversion tracking, measurement services and ad
    targeting based upon interests. If you would like to opt out of this

    <strong>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We will generally use the information that we collect to help us operate
    this App, to provide requested services, to help us understand our
    customers and their preferences, and to market products and services to you
    in which we believe you may be interested. The following provides a more
    specific discussion of our uses and disclosures of the information that we
    collect. We will seek your consent before we use your personal information
    for any other purposes
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Your contact information</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    When you provide us with your contact information, we will use that
    information to provide services related to this App. For example, if you
    purchase a product through our App, we will use your mailing address to
    direct the seller where to ship your order. We may also send you e-mail
    messages confirming your order or reporting on the status of your order.
</p>
<p>
    We may give you the option to add your e-mail address to one or more e-mail
    lists. You may change your preferences or opt out of all e-mails at any
    time by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link found at the bottom of each
    e-mail. Note that if you unsubscribe, we may still email you in connection
    with specific requests from you or regarding issues specific to you.
</p>
<p>
    We maintain a database about our customers and App users that allows us to
    (i) analyze and monitor consumer and customer activity, (ii) promote and
    support our products and services, and (iii) develop a knowledge base
    regarding our App users.
</p>
<p>
    We may combine the information we receive from and about you, including

    our App and services.

<p>

</p>
<p>
    If you purchase any goods or services through this App, your payment
    information, including your credit card and Apple Pay information, will be

    transaction. We will not have access to any payment information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Information shared with our business partners </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    To improve the products and services offered, we may use business partners
    to help us design and operate our App or provide other services to support
    the App. For example, we may hire a company to run certain applications,
    process credit card and Apple Pay payments, or help us analyze our data.
    Unless otherwise indicated on our App, if we allow our business partners to
    access the personal information we collect, it will be for limited purposes
    and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. We may give you the option to
    have your information shared with vendors whose goods or services may be of
    interest to us we carry so that they can send you coupons or other
    promotional information in which you are interested.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>Business operations, law enforcement and legal actions </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may release your information without prior notice when we believe it is
    appropriate to prevent fraud; to comply with law or to cooperate with law
    enforcement activity or other governmental request; to respond to
    subpoenas, court orders or administrative agency requests for information;
    to enforce our policies; to protect the rights, property and safety of our
    business and of others; or when required or otherwise permitted by law. For
    example, we may share information with law enforcement to reduce the risk
    of fraud or if someone uses or attempts to use our App for illegal reasons.
    If there is a sale or merger of the company, division or business unit that
    operates this App, we may also transfer the information we have collected
    in connection with such sale or merger.

    and our App development. Your comments and suggestions about our App
    development are always appreciated. Please contact us at    <a href="mailto:info@horselinc.com">info@horselinc.com</a> or (888)
