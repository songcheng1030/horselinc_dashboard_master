    laws and may not be copied or imitated in whole or in part.
</p>

    The App design, text and graphics, and the selection and arrangement of
    such elements are copyrighted and are protected by worldwide copyright laws

    Our trademarks cannot be used without an express, written license
    agreement. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection

    appear on this site are the property of their respective owners, who may or
    may not be affiliated with, connected to, or sponsored by Horse Apps.
</p>
<p>
    Horse Apps and/or its licensors own and shall retain all rights, title and
    interests, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the App,
    and all elements thereof. Except for the express licenses granted to you
    herein, you neither have nor acquire any rights, title or interests in or
    to the App, or any element thereof.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>SITE ACCESS, REGISTRATION, AND PASSWORDS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As a condition to using certain aspects of the Service, you may be required
    to register with Horse Apps and select a password and screen name ("User
    ID"). You shall provide Horse Apps with accurate, complete, and updated
    registration information. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of
    these Terms of Use, which may result in immediate termination of your Horse
    Apps Account. You shall not (i) select or use as a User ID or domain a name
    of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use as a
    User ID or domain a name subject to any rights of a person other than you
    without appropriate authorization; or (iii) use as a User ID or domain a
    name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene. We reserve the right
    to refuse registration of, or cancel a User ID and domain in its sole
    discretion.
</p>
<p>
    You are solely responsible for the security of online access to this App,
    including access to any user account ("Account"), and you must take
    precautions to protect the confidentiality of your password and User ID.
    You should not share your password or User ID with any other person or
    entity. You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of all
    transactions placed in your Account and for ensuring that you receive a
    confirmation for all transactions placed for your Account.
</p>
<p>
    You should contact Horse Apps immediately if you suspect unauthorized use
    of your password or User ID, or any other unauthorized activity on your
    Account. You are and will be responsible for all activities conducted on
    and with the App that make use of your password and/or User ID, and for any
    charges or fees incurred by the use of that password and/or User ID,
    including any use you may subsequently contend was not authorized by you.
    Horse Apps may justifiably assume that any orders or instructions received
    through any electronic systems and placed under your Account or password
    were placed or authorized by you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Eligibility</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 13 years
        old.
    </strong>
    You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding
    contract, and that all registration information you submit is accurate and
    truthful. Horse Apps may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the
    Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any
    time. This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right to
    access the Service is revoked in such jurisdictions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>USER CONTENT</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Service provides you with the ability to upload or otherwise provided
    information, data, text, software, photographs, graphics, messages,
    products, services and/or other materials (individually and collectively,
    "Content"). All Content is the sole responsibility of the person by whom
    the Content was posted. This means that you, and not us, are solely
    responsible for all Content that you upload, post, transmit or otherwise
    make available through or on this App. You are also solely responsible for
    all Content posted under your Account. Horse Apps does not control the
    Content posted on or through this App and, therefore, Horse Apps does not
    guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You represent
    and warrant that (i) you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the
    Content that you post; (ii) that the Content is accurate; (iii) use of the
    Content you supply does not violate this policy; (iv) the Content does not
    infringe any intellectual property or other rights of any third party and
    does not violate any applicable laws or regulation; and (v) the Content
    will not cause injury to any person or entity.
</p>
<p>
    Should Content be deemed illegal, Horse Apps will cooperate with the proper
    authorities, including but not limited to submitting all necessary
    information to them. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that any
    Content submitted by you is offensive or inappropriate we may ask you to
    retract or modify the Content in question or we may terminate your Account.
    We have no obligation, however, to restrict or monitor Content in any way.
</p>
<p>
    You may see or read things that you do not like or agree with on our App.
    You understand that by using our App, you may be exposed to Content that is
    offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will we be
    liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any
    errors or omissions in any Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind
    incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, transmitted or
    otherwise made available through our App. You acknowledge that we do not
    have any obligation to pre-screen Content, although we reserve the right,
    in our sole discretion, to refuse, move, or delete any Content.
</p>
<p>
    You are solely responsible for any use or reliance on the Content,
    including on its accuracy, completeness, or usefulness. You acknowledge
    that we do not have any obligation to pre-screen Content, but that we and
    our designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in our sole
    discretion to refuse or remove any Content that is available through our
    App. Without limiting the foregoing, we and our designees shall have the
    right to remove any Content that violates these Terms of Use or any other
    applicable policy or is otherwise objectionable. You agree that you must
    evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content,
    including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such
    Content.
</p>
<p>
    We do not want to receive any confidential or proprietary information from
    you through this App or by email. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by an
    authorized Horse Apps employee, any material, information or idea you
    transmit to Horse Apps or the App by any means may be disseminated or used
    by Horse Apps without compensation or liability to you for any purpose
    whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and
    marketing products. However, this provision does not apply to personal
    information that is subject to our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    We do not claim ownership of the Content you upload, place or post through
    this App. You are responsible for protecting your rights in such Content
    and are not entitled to our help in protecting such Content.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PROHIBITED BEHAVIORS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Your ability to use this App and contribute to discussions depends on your
    compliance with community standards and the conduct guidelines set forth in

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Ownership and License</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Horse Apps will not have any ownership rights in any elements of your
    Content; however, Horse Apps requires certain licenses to perform the
    Services. By uploading, placing or posting Content through this App, you
    grant and its authorized sublicensees and distributors, if any, a
    perpetual, irrevocable, world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive and fully
    sublicensable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt,
    translate, publicly perform, publicly display, and create derivative works
    from the Content (in whole or in part) and to incorporate such Content into
    other works in any format or medium now known or later developed, for any
    purpose associated with the App or Service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PRICING AND PAYMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You understand and agree that Horse Apps is a platform that users may use
    to sell their goods and services (“Products”) and that such users
    (“Sellers”) are solely responsible for such Products. By purchasing
    Products through the App, you are agreeing to purchase the Products
    selected. Your payment for the ordered Products is due at the time you
    submit your order. When you submit your order, your credit card or Apple
    Pay will be charged for the Products in accordance with the payment terms
    and conditions or the third party payment processor we utilize for such
    transactions. You warrant that if you enter into a transaction, then you
    shall be able to make full and immediate payment for the requested
    Products.
</p>
<p>
    All sales of goods and services are final (except where prohibited by law),
    unless otherwise determined by the Seller. If you do not receive the
    Products or otherwise have an issue with the Products delivered, please
    contact Horse Apps with your request and proof of payment, and we will
    attempt to resolve your issue. At Horse Apps’s sole discretion, you may be
    credited or refunded for the Products. However, it is ultimately the
    responsibility of you and the Seller to resolve any payment or other issues
    related to the Products.
</p>
<p>
    Your total price for Products will include the price of the Products plus
    Horse App’s convenience fee and any applicable sales tax; such sales tax is
    based on your location and the sales tax rate in effect at the time you
    purchase the product.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>SELLER FEES AND PAYMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As your sole and exclusive consideration for the Products you provide to
    other Horse Apps users, you shall be entitled to the fee paid by such user
    less Horse App’s convenience fee (which is subject to change at any time at
    Horse App’s discretion) and any applicable sales tax.
</p>
<p>
    Horse Apps may withhold any taxes, duties, charges or levies on payments by
    Horse Apps to you pursuant to this Agreement as may be required by
    applicable law, rule or regulation. Horse Apps shall remit any such
    withheld taxes, duties, charges or levies to the appropriate tax authority.
    You shall complete any required tax documentation as provided to you by
    Horse Apps upon Horse Apps’s request. Failure to do so shall negate Horse
    Apps’s payment obligations to you.
</p>
<p>
    When you receive a payment for Products sales, you are liable to Horse Apps
    for the full amount of the payment sent to you if the payment is later
    invalidated for any reason. This means that, in addition to any other
    liability, you will be responsible for the amount of the payment sent by
    the buyer if there is a chargeback, a dispute, or if there is a reversal of
    the payment. You agree to allow Horse Apps to recover any amounts due to
    Horse Apps by debiting your Account. If there are insufficient funds to
    cover your liability, you agree to reimburse Horse Apps through other
    means.
</p>
<p>
    Horse Apps retains the right, but does not have the obligation, to
    immediately halt the offering or sale of any Products, prevent or restrict
    access to the App or the Services or take any other action in case of
    technical problems, objectionable material, inaccurate listings, or actions
    otherwise prohibited by the procedures and guidelines contained on the App,
    or for any other reason in the sole and absolute discretion of Horse Apps,
    and to correct any inaccurate listing or technical problems on the App.
    Horse Apps may immediately halt the offering or sale of any Products upon
    receipt of notifications of claimed infringement, upon acquiring knowledge
    of actual infringement, or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from
    which infringing material is apparent with respect to any Products.
